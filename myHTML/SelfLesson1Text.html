	This is the approriate code to comment out code.
	
	This is my usual initial lesson program illustrating what I have learned about a new laungauge.
	
	Notes:
		You cannot create a new line by returning you must use break and paragraph commands. lIsted Below  
-->


<!-- This is the Header -->
<head>							
	
<meta charset="utf-8" />				<!-- This is a Mando. Character command -->

<title>TLOK Text Page</title>				<!-- The "title" names the page like a window header but is not visible on a mac? -->

<meta name="TLOK Text Page" />		<!-- I don't yet know why we need this -->

</head>
<!-- Close Header -->



<!-- Now start the Body -->
<body>

	<!-- Lastly, we need to know how to create links in text -->
	<!-- This creates a local link -->

	<!-- This creates an outside link-->
	Click <a href="https://lockerlawoffice.com/">here</a> to go to LLO page.
<!-- Lets start with a header which can range from 1 to 6 in terms of rank and therefore inverse size-->
	<h1> Header 1, which is the most important </h1>
	<h6> Header 6, which is the least imortant.</h6>


<!-- Text Controls -->
	<!-- Starting with new line commands -->
		First, we should point out that headers create their own new lines, but other things will require break and paragraph commands. <br /> The Break command puts the text after it on the next line. 
			<br />  <br /> <!--This is the break command and the space is not required-->

		After Demonstrating we move to Paragraph commands which adds leading space <p> The text in between the opening and closing "p" brackets appears here. </p> and after following space the text after appears here.
			<p> </p> <!-- This is the paragrapgh command n HTML -->

		You Are also allowed to use <div> div commands </div> which we see here, create divisions without adding spaces.
			<div></div> <!-- This is the div command -->





	<!-- Next lets look at Font style and size -->
	
	<h1>Font Type Demonstration</h1>
	
		
		<!-- Font Size -->
		<h3>Font Sizing</h3>
		This is an example of default HTML text which is size 3. In browser font can range between 1 and 7.
		<br />

		<font size = "+4">
			This text is +4 for a total of 7? 
		</font> <br />

		The font after the closing tag goes back to size 3.
		<br />
		<font size = "-2">
			This text is -2 for a total of 1?
		</font><br />
		If we remove the operator from the function we can specify an "absolute"
		<br />
		<font size = 5>
			This text should be size 5?
		</font>
		<br />
		
		
		
		
		<!-- Font Type -->
		<h3>Font Type</h3>
		

			<p style = "font-family:copperplate;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;">
         
			This text should demonstrate the font sytle function

			</p>
			
			And this text should go back to standard font
			
			
			
			
		<!-- Font Postition -->
		<h3>Font position</h3>
			<center>
				<h2>How Not to Center with HTML</h2>
				<p>This text may be centered...but you would be better off using CSS to center text or other elements on a web page.</p>
			</center>

		
		<!-- Font Color -->
		<h3>Next lets look at font color</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- color attribute of html works like this -->
				 <font color="red">This is some text in red using color_name function!</font> 
				 <br />
				 <font color="RGB (34,162,0)" >This is some text in green? using rgb_number function! Only this doesn't work </font>
				 				 <!-- This RGB function would appear to be the piece of the color attribute that no longer works in HTML 5 HELP -->
				 				 
				 <font color="34455c"> <h4> This is a Header </h4> This is some text in Locker Lawfirm Blue using hex_number function!</font>
				 <br />
				
				 
				 
				 
				<!-- This does not work in HTML 5 which recommends that we use CSS to perform this task -->
				<!-- Note this line is CSS not HTML -->
					<p style="color:red"> 
					Test this Red line like this
					<br />
					
					<p style="color:rgb(34,162,0)"> 
					and this green line like this
					<br />
					
					<p style="color:#33455c"> 
					and this locker law firm blue line like this which requires use of the # to function.
				 
			</p>
		
		<!-- Highlighting text -->
			<p>
				<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Yellow text using HTML.</span>
				<br />
				<mark>highlighted text</mark> using the &lt;mark&gt; tag (this is HTML 5). <!-- NOTE This also demostrates escape code for carrots -->
				<br />


				<!-- Finally we demonstrate CSS witch begins by creating a class -->
				<style>
					body { background-color:none; }
					.highlightme { background-color:#FFFF00; }
					p { background-color:#FFFFFF; }
				</style>
				<!-- and then publishes a line calling the class previously defined above -->
				<span class="highlightme">This Text should be highlighted utilizing the class based highlighter!</span>

			</p>

		<!-- Creating a border around a paragraph using HTML-->
			<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">
				First example with text surrounded by a red border.
			<br>
				<span class="highlightme">This Text should be highlighted utilizing the class based highlighter and using the red box!</span>
			</p>
		
		<!-- Now Creating a border using CSS-->
			<!-- Creating the class for border box-->
			<style>
				.borderexample
				{
					border-style:solid;
					border-color:#287EC7;
				}
			</style>

		<!-- Using the class (style) -->
			<p class="borderexample">Here is an example of a border created using CSS</p>

</body>		<!--This is the Body End -->
</html>		<!--This is the Page End -->
